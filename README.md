# CROWN SHOP ANGULAR

Welcome to Crown Shop, your premier destination for stylish men's and women's apparel. Crafted with passion and built using the robust Angular framework, our shop offers a seamless shopping experience. ðŸ©·ðŸ©·

## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get Crown Shop running on your computer. This guide assumes you're setting it up for a development environment to tweak it, play around, or contribute to its growth.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js - Our runtime environment
- Angular CLI - To run Angular commands with ease
- A good code editor - We recommend VSCode for an optimized Angular experience

Download Node.js here: [Node.js Download Page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Install Angular CLI globally using this command:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Installing and Running the Project

#### Setting up the Server

To set up the server:

1. **Open your terminal or command prompt.**

2. **Navigate to the Server Directory**:

   Replace `path/to/server` with the actual server directory path.

   ```bash
   cd path/to/server
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   This command fetches all necessary packages to run the server.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Fire up the Server**:

   This command starts the server, making it listen for incoming requests.

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

#### Setting up the Angular Client

To get the client up and running:

1. **Navigate to the Client Directory**:

   Replace `path/to/client` with the actual client directory path.

   ```bash
   cd path/to/client
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Fetch all the required packages that power the client.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Launch the Angular Development Server**:

   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```
   After a short while, you'll have the client running on `http://localhost:4200`.

### Running Tests

For testing the waters and ensuring everything is shipshape:

- Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
- Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

### Deployment

To take Crown Shop live:

- Consider deployment platforms like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). They offer a straightforward process for deploying Angular applications.
